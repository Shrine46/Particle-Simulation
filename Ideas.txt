have a on/off switch for a brush that will spawn in electrons within the brush circle, (more the bigger the brush)
    -the brush could be made by having a circle follow the mouse, I don't know if hiding the mouse is possible
    -maybe have the brush be turned off or on with a button press instead like "b"

make explosion when two particles collide above a cerain speed
    - Maybe make that generate a outwards force

add a tail to the particles

add sliders to adjust constants
